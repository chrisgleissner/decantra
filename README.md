Decantra is a bottle-sorting puzzle game for Android built in Unity.

## How to Play

- Drag one bottle onto another to pour liquid.
- You can only pour onto the same color or into an empty segment.
- A level is complete when all bottles are either empty or contain exactly one color.
- Some bottles are anchored (dark base): they can receive liquid but cannot be lifted.
- Bottles may have different capacity, and later levels add more colors and constraints.

## Features

- Infinite, procedurally generated puzzles.
- Move budgets that reward efficient play.
- Varied bottle sizes and anchored sink bottles for added challenge.
- Smooth, mobile-first controls designed for short sessions.
- Configurable starfield effect
